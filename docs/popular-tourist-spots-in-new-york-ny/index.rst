This iconic monument was a gift from the people of France to the United States in 1886, commemorating the alliance between the two nations during the American Revolution. Designed by the French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, the statue stands at an impressive height of 305 feet, including its pedestal. Its construction required a tremendous effort, with countless hours spent shaping copper sheets into the majestic form we see today.

Times Square's transformation from a humble carriage district to a global attraction is a remarkable story.
